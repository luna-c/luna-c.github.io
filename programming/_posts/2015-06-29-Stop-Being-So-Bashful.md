title: Stop Being So Bashful

Today I learned that predefined arguments in functions are then optional to define. I exposed myself to [hashing](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/SortSearch/Hashing.html), hash functions and collisions,`bubblesorts` and the *divide and conquer* strategy in `binary search`.

Overall, I am feeling way more confident reading unfamiliar code and tracking what's happening. I like to read and I think reading good code helps me learn. Also, writing out different modules and tracing how code is executed with arrows I find really helpful too. I'm imagining writing a **book** for readers like myself that helps you learn to read and write code just by reading code. In my other readings, I started dipping into [The Art of Doing Science and Engineering](http://worrydream.com/refs/Hamming-TheArtOfDoingScienceAndEngineering.pdf) and I'm absolutely loving it.

In this installment of my Kivy struggles, I present `-bash`. I downloaded Anaconda as a step in the process of getting Kivy. Now I can't get rid of `-bash` in my Terminal. What on earth that does, I have no idea. I read some stackoverflow posts. One made my stomach feel queasy referencing all the different layers to my computer. Layers that I will one day have to comprehend (That's why I love this though because it scares the hell out of me in a fun, daunting way). I threw my hesitations to the wind and tried using `tidy`. Then I tried `ps` to identify things to `kill -# ####`, which I did--kill. This is on top of the other issues I've had with installing kivy. What a troublemaker. Letting that go for the day.

Last week I applied to the Recurse Center only to withdraw my application a few days later. The timing felt off for going through with the application. As much as a I want to study there, I don't want to compromise my learning process. Another few months and I'll make another bid.
