Iâ€™ve been studying the Python Programming Language for a couple months now. Yesterday I listened to [Episode 2](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/ep-2-coding-like-a-boss-w-brian-douglas) with Brian Douglas on the Code Newbie Podcast. His talk gave me the push I needed to chronicle my journey learning Python. Let the snake charming officially commence...

Some tricks I learned today:

* Using an empty raw_input() call for instance after a string that calls for the use to press RETURN is a way to pause mid output in IDLE and create user interactivity

* When importing a module that happens to share a name with a function inside itself, you use .(period) notation between the two names accounting for both entities of code -- ie alpha.alpha()
