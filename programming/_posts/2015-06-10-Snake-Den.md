Today was a battle. I tried getting through some exercises on check.io and they didn’t go so well. So I’m a little discouraged.

Earlier I fooled around with Scott Hanselman’s [Keys Left](http://keysleft.com/) . Cool to know I type around 50 words per minute. 

Other things I accomplished today... I outlined an idea for an app. I downloaded Django, Git, Github, and Kivy. I know I need to stay focused on Python.
