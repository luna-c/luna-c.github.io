title: Code is what?
---

I took the time today to read the 38,000 words in Paul Ford's [What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/). Here are some of the terminology highlights I liked: 

* "[Programmers] sell infinitely reproducible nothings"
* "Big iron is cool"
* "Things are fluid in the world of programming, fluid in a way that other industries don’t seem to be"
* "People who overthink programming are “architecture astronauts”"
* "Sometimes bugs cause error messages to pop up; sometimes they cause the program to give up the ghost and quit suddenly; sometimes they get caught in terrible loops and fill up the memory and choke all the resources of the computer until it has to be restarted. That’s called a stack overflow."

Thank you, Paul. Loved the article.
