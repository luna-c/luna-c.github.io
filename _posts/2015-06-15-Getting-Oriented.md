title: Getting Oriented 
---

I fooled around today with the Tkinter GUI; I followed along with this [tutorial](http://zetcode.com/gui/tkinter/). After typing through some of the examples I went back to an old faithful of mine, the [Runstone Interactive Textbook](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pip/Assignments/week3.html#problem-set) library. Nice to work through problems from scratch and craft solutions.

In other news, the concept of Object-oriented programming is finally taking root. I'm beginning to understand when certain chunks of code need to be objectified in order to perform other operations on "objects". Put another way, operations transform objects to make room for other operations that create more objects. (Its nice practice putting into words what I'm learning for all code newbies reading this.)

Right now I am reading James Agee's *[Let Us Now Praise Famous Men](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/243360.Let_Us_Now_Praise_Famous_Men)*. He employed a ton of colons in his book, both traditionally and unconventionally. For instance, he broke proper  usage rules by ending sentences and paragraphs with colons. By doing so, he created for the reader(*me*) the idea of simultaneously refining and expanding his thoughts. I thought this tied in beautifully with Programming and Python. What follows is a passage from the book where Agee explicitly refers to his colon use and then works his magic...


*"This is all one colon:*

*Here at a center is a creature: it would be our business to show how through every instant of every day of every year of his existence alive he is from all sides streamed inward upon, bombarded, pierced, destroyed by that enormous sleeting of all objects forms and ghosts how great how small no matter, which surround and whom his senses take: in as great and perfect and exact particularity as we can name them:*

*This would be our business, to show them each thus transfixed as between the stars' trillions of javelins and of each the transfixions: but it is beyond my human power to do. The most I can do--the most I can hope to do--is to make a number of physical entities as plain and vivid as possible, and to make a few guesses, a few conjectures; and to leave to you much burden of realizing in each of them what I have wanted to make clear of them as a whole: how each is itself; and how each is a shapener."*

As you can see, Agee helped me grasp OOP.
