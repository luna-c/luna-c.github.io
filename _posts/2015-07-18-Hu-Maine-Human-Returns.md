title: Hu-Maine Human Returns
---

Been off in Maine studying python by night and organic farming by day. Spent some time at the [Morgan Bay Zendo](http://www.morganbayzendo.org/) too.

I finished [Dive Into Python](http://www.amazon.com/Dive-Into-Python-Mark-Pilgrim/dp/1590593561) this week. I loved the chapters on Unit Testing. Right now I am reading [The Most Human Human](http://www.amazon.com/Most-Human-Artificial-Intelligence-Teaches/dp/0307476707/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1437265316&sr=1-1&keywords=the+most+human+human). So far, my favorite idea from the book is...

>In the world of Machines, we authenticate on **content**. In the human world, we authenticate on **form**.

I also read through this [tutorial](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/?utm_source=Python+Weekly+Newsletter&utm_campaign=9a597d65f3-Python_Weekly_Issue_200_July_16_2015&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9e26887fc5-9a597d65f3-312751213) on building neural networks python. It seems really cool. I can somewhat understand the code but the ideas behind it are over my head at this point.
