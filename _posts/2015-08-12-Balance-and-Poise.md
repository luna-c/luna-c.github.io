I liked the following passage from [The Secret Doctrine of the Rosicrucians](http://www.sacred-texts.com/sro/sdr/sdr14.htm)...

"Poise is Power. Poise results from Balance. Balance is secured by adjusting and maintaining the Centre between the Poles of the Pairs of Opposites. By Balanced Poise the Master neutralizes Polarity and Rhythm, by resolving them into Unity. In the Heart of the Storm is Peace. In the Centre of Life there is Poise and Power. Seek ever, Poise and Balance, and you will have Power and Peace."
