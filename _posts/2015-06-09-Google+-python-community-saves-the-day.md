So I had a great Boston Python Meetup on Monday. Tom helped me get things straight in the terminal. He really helped me understand the layout and interconnection of folders. He showed me null, which is like a trash bin on steroids. He also showed me lots of fancy keyboard tricks, very few of which I actually remember but great to witness the power nonetheless. Things likeâ€¦

* Tilde or ~/ for shortcutting through the directory

* the up arrow for pulling up a previous call in the terminal 

* tab key for finishing a directory name when typing

I also found a great community on [google+](https://plus.google.com/communities/103393744324769547228) for python newbies. I asked my first question too on `from  import`. I was stuck on importing a module for an app I was building in [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex47.html). It turns out I was trying to import a .py program instead of importing a function. So that was a helpful clarification of the framework. 

I'll say that Github and stackoverflow are pretty intimidating right now. I'm looking at the google+ community as a great bridge to those larger platforms.
