title: Dive Into My Underlines

Here are my underlines from [Dive Into Python](http://www.amazon.com/Dive-Into-Python-Mark-Pilgrim/dp/1590593561)...

* create a *raw string* by affixing `r` before the string
* the built in `__name__` attribute is a special value, `__main__`
* using the `locals()` and `globals()` functions, you can get value of arbitrary variables dynamically, while `locals() is read-only and `globals()` is not read-only.
