title: Introducing lunacy!
---

*Hello* *World*. I created **this** blog over the last two days. I forked [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) to use as my site template. I also downloaded [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I want to figure out how to add site content from the command line. 

After this post, I am migrating just a few posts manually from a Tumblr. I heard on [Episode 23](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/ask-codenewbie) of the Code Newbie Podcast that using GH Pages with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) was a great way to create a site. So I thought this would encourage me to use [Github](http://github.com) more. Lo and behold, its already presentated a few learning opportunities that tumblr eliminates for  users. 
* Forking the theme
* Editing pages and the overall template
* Working with Github's MarkDown 

Excited to see my progress evolves after a month or two!
