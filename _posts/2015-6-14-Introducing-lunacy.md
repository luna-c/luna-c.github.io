title: Introducing lunacy!
---

*Hello* *World*. I created **this** blog over the last two days. I forked [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) to use as my site template. I also downloaded [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I want to figure out how to add site content from the command line. 

After this post, I am migrating just a few posts manually from a Tumblr. I heard on the Code Newbie podcast that using GH Pages with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) was a great way to create a site. So I thought this would be great encouragement for using [Github](http://github.com) more. Lo and behold, its already presentated a few learning opportunities that tumblr eliminates for the user. Forking the theme, adding and editing pages through code, and looking at Github's Markdown for the first time. Excited to see my progress on here after a month or two!
