I was listening to the [Talk Python To Me](http://www.talkpythontome.com/episodes/show/4/enterprise-python-and-large-scale-projects) podcast and came across Allison Kaptur's Pycon Talk [Bytes in the Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVUTjQzESeo). I enjoyed her talk. Like most Python talks I've watched in the past, speakers do an incredible job of simplifying techniques while leaving out a lot of the complexities. I also watched Guido Van Rossum's keynote and that was fun. 

I fooled around with a exercises in [Programming Python](http://kysmykseka.net/koti/wizardry/Programming/Python/Programming%20Python,%204th%20Edition%20(2010).pdf). On one of them, I was using the os.system module in the interpreter to analyze program type. The code was as follows:

```
>>> os.system('type helloshell.py') 

# a Python program

print('The Meaning of Life')

0 
```

I am fascinated by this returning zero (0). To summarize a perfectly knit together program with zero (0) implies nothing and everything. I love that.

Programming Python is the perfect book for where I'm at right now and I'm loving it.

Also I found the [Zen Mode](https://github.com/blog/1379-zen-writing-mode) of writing on Github which I love! It should significantly increase my post output. Do check it out!
